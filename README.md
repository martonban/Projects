# Projects

This repository lists the projects I have developed over the years. These projects are generally smaller in scope compared to [BagEngine](https://github.com/martonban/BagEngine) or [RenderLamp](https://github.com/martonban/RenderLamp), but I believe they are still worth showcasing. Naturally, there are quality differences among these projects, as some are incomplete, abandoned, or still under development, and may not fully reflect my software development capabilities. The [following tables](https://github.com/martonban/Projects?tab=readme-ov-file#legend-quality) will provide a legend, which will be included next to each project.

# Old/College Projects
Over the years, I have developed numerous projects. While the majority of them are nearly complete, they remain unfinished or lack the desired level of quality.

# Look Development
I am deeply passionate about computer graphics, and I experiment with various topics within this field, primarily focusing on look development. You can find PBR materials I created using Substance Designer or Blender, as well as shaders and VFX I developed with Unity or Unreal Shader Graph.
