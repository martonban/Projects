# Projects

This repository lists the projects I have developed over the years. These projects are generally smaller in scope compared to [RenderLamp](https://github.com/martonban/RenderLamp) or [Arca](https://github.com/martonban/Arca), but I believe they are still worth showcasing. Naturally, there are quality differences among these projects, as some are incomplete, abandoned, or still under development, and may not fully reflect my software development capabilities.
I have categorized the projects by topics. Each topic will have a short description along with a table listing the projects, supplemented with a brief summary. The list is actually ordered based on quality. At the top are the projects that I believe turned out the best, in the middle are the average ones, and at the bottom are the unfinished projects that I abandoned for some reason. 
The purpose of this list is to provide a general overview of my software development background. Each project in the list has a more detailed description, so it's worth checking them out!


**NOTE! THIS LIST IS CURRENTLY UNDER REMAKE!**
