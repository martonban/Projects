# Projects
**IMPORTANT: THIS README IS NOT READY !!** <br />
In this repository I listed projects which are mainly created during my high school and university years. Note these project are not the best quality, and you can find a wide variant of topics. This is not my direct showcase of my software engineering skills.

# Launcher (C#, WinForms)
A really simple game launcher with a ""backend"" (The backend in this case some json files, and a folder in a PC). It was a college assignment and the main aim was create a UI application. <br>
