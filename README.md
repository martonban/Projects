# Projects

This repository lists the projects I have developed over the years. These projects are generally smaller in scope but I believe they are still worth showcasing. Naturally, there are quality differences among these projects, as some are incomplete, abandoned, or still under development and may not fully reflect my software development capabilities; however, projects marked with the ðŸŒŸ emoji represent a higher level of quality and are therefore especially recommended for checking out.

The purpose of this list is to provide a general overview of my software development background. Each project in the list has a more detailed description, so it's worth checking them out!

# Computing and Math 
To understand computer graphics, it is essential to have a strong foundation in mathematics and to optimize the computational capacity of the computer. The following list contains the projects aimed at expanding my knowledge in these areas.
