# Projects

In this repository I listed my "honorable mentions" projects. There are a wide variety of topics I touched over the years, and I just want to show them. Note these projects are not a direct showcase of my software engineering skills, because most of them are unfinished or tutorial/practice projects, and of courses. Some of them are slightly better, so I've marked them with a ðŸŒŸ emoji - these are worth checking out. <br>
If you want see some of my quality project check out my ray tracer called [RenderLamp](https://github.com/martonban/RenderLamp) or my 2D Game Engine

# Hobby Projects 
I LOVE Computer Graphics so I experimenting with different topic on this filed. Mainly look dev. You can see PBR materials I did in Substance Designer or blender. Shaders/VFX I did with Unity Shader Graph.
