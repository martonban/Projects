# Projects
**IMPORTANT: THIS README IS NOT READY !!** <br />
In this repository I listed my "honorable mentions" projects. There are a wide variety of topics I touched over the years, and I just want to show them. Note these projects are not a direct showcase of my software engineering skills, because most of them are unfinished or tutorial/practice projects. <br>
