# Projects

This repository lists the projects I have developed over the years. These projects are generally smaller in scope compared to [RenderLamp](https://github.com/martonban/RenderLamp) or [Arca](https://github.com/martonban/Arca), but I believe they are still worth showcasing. Naturally, there are quality differences among these projects, as some are incomplete, abandoned, or still under development, and may not fully reflect my software development capabilities.
I have categorized the projects by topics. Each topic will have a short description along with a table listing the projects, supplemented with a brief summary. The list is actually ordered based on quality. At the top are the projects that I believe turned out the best, in the middle are the average ones, and at the bottom are the unfinished projects that I abandoned for some reason. 
The purpose of this list is to provide a general overview of my software development background. Each project in the list has a more detailed description, so it's worth checking them out!


**NOTE! THIS LIST IS CURRENTLY UNDER REMAKE!**

# Computing and Math 
To understand computer graphics, it is essential to have a strong foundation in mathematics and to optimize the computational capacity of the computer. The following list contains the projects aimed at expanding my knowledge in these areas.

# Game Development 

# Web/App Development
Over the years, I have developed numerous projects. While the majority of them are nearly complete, they remain unfinished or lack the desired level of quality.
| Project        | Descripton                      |
|----------------| ----------------------------------|
| [Launcher](https://github.com/martonban/Launcher)                                 | This is a C#/WinForm collage assigment with a simple "backend"          |
| [Full Stack Web App](https://github.com/martonban/FullStackWebAppUniAssignment)  | Collage assigment with Angular and Typescript                     |
| [Emfis](https://github.com/martonban/Emfis)                                      | My first big project in Visual Basic and WinForms                  |


# Tech Art
I am deeply passionate about computer graphics, and I experiment with various topics within this field, primarily focusing on look development. You can find PBR materials I created using Substance Designer or Blender, as well as shaders or VFX I developed with Unity/Unreal Shader Graph.
