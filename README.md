# Projects

This repository lists the projects I have developed over the years. These projects are generally smaller in scope but I believe they are still worth showcasing. Naturally, there are quality differences among these projects, as some are incomplete, abandoned, or still under development and may not fully reflect my software development capabilities; however, projects marked with the ðŸŒŸ emoji represent a higher level of quality and are therefore especially recommended for checking out.

The purpose of this list is to provide a general overview of my software development background. Each project in the list has a more detailed description, so it's worth checking them out!


# C++
These projects either contain smaller C++ projects or repositories created with the intent of learning.

# Tech Art/Art
I am deeply passionate about computer graphics, and I experiment with various topics within this field, primarily focusing on look development. You can find PBR materials I created using Substance Designer or Blender, as well as shaders or VFX I developed with Unity/Unreal Shader Graph.
