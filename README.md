# Projects

This repository lists the projects I have developed over the years. These projects are generally smaller in scope compared to [RenderLamp](https://github.com/martonban/RenderLamp) or [Arca](https://github.com/martonban/Arca) but I believe they are still worth showcasing. Naturally, there are quality differences among these projects, as some are incomplete, abandoned, or still under development, and may not fully reflect my software development capabilities.

The purpose of this list is to provide a general overview of my software development background. Each project in the list has a more detailed description, so it's worth checking them out!


**NOTE! THIS LIST IS CURRENTLY UNDER REMAKE!**

# Tech Art
I am deeply passionate about computer graphics, and I experiment with various topics within this field, primarily focusing on look development. You can find PBR materials I created using Substance Designer or Blender, as well as shaders or VFX I developed with Unity/Unreal Shader Graph.
