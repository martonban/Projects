# Projects
**IMPORTANT: THIS README IS NOT READY !!** <br />
In this repository I listed my "honorable mentions" projects. There are a wide variety of topics I touched over the years, and I just want to show them. Note these projects are not a direct showcase of my software engineering skills, because most of them are unfinished or tutorial/practice projects, and of courses. Some of them are slightly better, so I've marked them with a ðŸŒŸ emoji - these are worth checking out. <br>
If you want see some of my quality project check out my ray tracer called [RenderLamp](https://github.com/martonban/RenderLamp) or my [quality graphics projects](https://github.com/martonban/GraphicsProjects).

# Practice Projects
These repositories were primarily started as portfolio projects or for experimenting. However, due to their lack of high quality or originality, I don't consider them suitable as portfolio worthy projects.

# Old/Collage Projects
Over the years, I have developed many projects. While most of them are nearly complete, they remain unfinished or lack high quality.
